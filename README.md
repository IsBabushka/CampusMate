## Introduction

CampusMate is a robust Java-based application designed to streamline campus management for administrators, teachers, and students alike. It offers a seamless experience across multiple user roles, providing tailored dashboards and tools to meet the specific needs of each user group. CampusMate aims to simplify complex processes and provide actionable insights, empowering educational institutions to focus on learning and growth.

## Technologies Used

CampusMate leverages a variety of technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and user-friendliness:

-   **Java:** Core programming language for backend logic and database interactions through Data Access Objects (DAOs).
-   **JFreeChart:** For generating dynamic charts and visualizations in the admin dashboard.
-   **Java Swing:** For creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
-   **BCrypt:** For secure password hashing.
-   **MySQL:** For reliable data storage and management.
-   **Object-Oriented Design:** Ensuring modular and loosely coupled code structure.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to maintain clarity and ease of navigation:

-   `src/MyApps`: Contains the main application classes and forms.
-   `src/MyLibs`: Houses utility classes and data access objects.
-   `src/Icons`: Stores icons used in the application.
-   `db`: Contains SQL script for schema creation.

## Installation

To install and run CampusMate, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
